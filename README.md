# customstack
Example of dynamically allocating a new stack and using that stack. 

# What
This is some example source which allocates a new stack, uses that stack, and restores the original stack.  
The documentation for this example is inline in the source.  This all came about as an exploration
into dynamically allocated (runtime) stacks, similar to what lightweight threads accomplish with 
split-stacks.
